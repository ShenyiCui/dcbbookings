### Making your first booking:
To create your first reservation in a Room/Device you must first find the room you want to book. You may use the search feature, shown on the main page or click and search through all the available resources. 

Once you click on the resource the main timetable panel would show up, showing you the availability of the room's schedule. 

#### Room Admins
```
You can become a room admin if you are the person who created the resource (Super-Admin).
Or if the person who created the resource added you as a Sub-Admin. 

note that only the super-admin will have the ability to edit resource settings.
```
As a room admin you will see 4 options in the viewport when a period is selected.
